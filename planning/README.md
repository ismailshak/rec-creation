## ERD

The Entities that we chose for our ERD were User, Events, Games, and the option to add in Supplies for the Games.

We chose this layout for our relationships to have the User move through the events to find Games to either join or host.

The Users can have one or many events by either hosting or participating in the events. Users can also search for individual games.

Events can only have one game but many users as host or participants

Games can have none or multiple events.
